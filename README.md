# Tetris game

## 1. Code Attribution

### _All the code has been written by both of us, although we took inspiration from professor's Minimax Code shared on google colab_

## 2. Installation of dependencies.

``` 
pip3 install matplotlib
 
pip3 install numpy

pip3 install pandas

pip3 install torch
```

## 3. Running the interactive domain

#### Running the interactive domain is just as it was specified (run play_tetris.py)
#### 1. Choose the problem size
#### 2. Select player type human, baseline ai, expectimax tree
#### If you choose human, it will show you all the possible moves you have by displaying a list of coordinates where the shape can be placed, if you want to choose the first move enter 0 and so on until (n-1), please note there is no error handling for inputs so if there was a wrong choice pressed one needs to restart the process
#### For baseline you only need to press enter, the code pauses every move and waits for your input, same goes for expectimax AI

#### Final score is then returned once there are no valid moves remaining.

## 4. Running the Tree experiments

#### Every experiment has its own file experiment{no}.py, run that file to run the experiment. The most important thing to note while running an experiment is, under every experiment.py file there is a if __name__ == main code block which has a comment.

#### This comment includes a code snippet, that you need to replace within shape.py file, more instructions are written under each experiment file, these code snippets change the probabilities of shapes which was given in our proposal.

## 5. Running the Neural Network experiments

#### As required we included 4 experiments to run them, you need to run experiment_apurva_nn.py and experiment_avantika_nn.py. When we ran the expiremnts we saw that our batch error go down to 2 digits, if you see that the batch error is not at all decreasing use this command:

```
python3 -B experimennt_{student_name}_nn.py
```

#### The -B ensures that no cache is saved, if that doesnt work use the regular:

```
python3 experimennt_{student_name}_nn.py
```

#### Thank you
